Main objection is to learn something cool, another objection is to be more
productive.

We all know programming is not about writing tons of text every day - it's
about ideas and discipline. Discipline means refactoring and refactoring means
navigation. So I guess my goal is to be as same in writing new code as I am now
in Textmate, but to become better in restructuring already existing code.
 
My first discovery Vim is pretty complex and there is not much literature to
actually practice Vim. There is good book by Drew Neal, but it lacks practical
exercises. From "Learn python the hard way" by Zed Show 
I learned what if you want to master something, you need to
practice a lot. While I need to do lots of text editing, majority of books
concentrate on giving you terminology and tricks, which is pretty hard to use
while you still barely can navigate the document. 

So, I will take it slow, by first mastering navigation. Will see how it goes.

Good day!
